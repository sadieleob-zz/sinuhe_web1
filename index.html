                        Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, 
                      and engineering that form the basis for the design and use 
                      of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach 
                      to computation and its applications and the systematic study 
                      of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization 
                      of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the 
                      acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication 
                      of, and access to, information. An alternate, more succinct 
                      definition of computer science is the study of automating 
                      algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes 
                      in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.
